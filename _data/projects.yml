    Repository of templates for machine learning, created
    during a Udemy course. If anyone is interested in seeing
    what kind of code is needed for the different types, then
    these are a good indication of the level needed. I will 
    use these for future projects, where I have some ideas
    that I want to try.

    Dissertation project regarding MPC and LQR controls for 
    the lateral controls of a formula student car. The paper 
    for this can be found in the writing section of my website.
    The project was done with a very tight schedule and therefore 
    the code could do with some care to make it faster and look 
    cleaner.

    Video which I created to help Danish students wanting to become 
    Race engineers. In Denmark the university system does not support 
    Motorsport, so it can be very difficult to know what to do.
