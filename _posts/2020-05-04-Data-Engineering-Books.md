## Introduction:  

{% include figure.html path="blog/DEBooks/data.png" alt="Example Data" %}

Studying to the level of MSc, means I have come into contact with many different 
books. Therefore, I thought it would be nice to make a list of the books I enjoyed 
the most. This list is not trying to be innovative, but maybe you find one or two 
that you have not heard about.

## Introduction to Data Analysis
Title: Making Sense of Squiggly Lines
Author: Christopher Brown

This is a great book for anyone wanting to become a Data Engineer, as it present 
actual data and takes you through the analysis process. It goes through many different 
concepts in data analysis, which then gives you the tools to take your first job. 
The book is based on the AIM package, but the knowledge can transfer to any software 
package. The book is also very easy to read, and I had a hard time putting the book 
down, once I started reading it. Unfortunately, the book is not very long and that is 
then main drawback of the book. Because of the length it never really goes into 
depth about any of the subjects, which may not be necessary for your first job, but 
will be necessary to get to the next level. But from my experience, unless you are 
working in high end motorsport, then this book will give you the tools that you need. 
The limiting factor for data analysis in most cases is regulation or budget of the team, 
which means that you have a limited number of sensors. If you want to try and get around 
this then I recommend looking at my vehicle dynamics book recommendation, but modelling 
has its own disadvantages.

## The Next Level
Title: Analysis Techniques for Racecar Data Acquisition
Author: Jorge Segers

This book is really the holy bible of data analysis, with around 500 pages of topics 
ranging from the basics to Aero and Tire analysis. If you are going into higher end 
teams where they have a large number of sensors. Sometimes it can be hard to have 
a large amount of data and knowing what exactly to do with it, this is where this book 
comes in. It details equations, methods and goes through concepts, which helps you 
take your data analysis skills to the next level. The book is not as easy to read
as "Making Sense of Squiggly Lines", but reading it is well worth it. But as with 
many of these types of books, then you can read the sections that fit with your teams 
needs. This book really helped my team in Oxford Brookes Racing, improve the amount 
of information we got from our data and I would recommend it to any engineer dealing 
with data from a race car.
