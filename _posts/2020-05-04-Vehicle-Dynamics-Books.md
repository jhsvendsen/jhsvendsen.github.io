## Introduction:  

{% include figure.html path="blog/PEBooks/MeandHenrik.jpg" alt="Data Engineering" %}

Studying to the level of MSc, means I have come into contact with many different 
books. Therefore, I thought it would be nice to make a list of the books I enjoyed 
the most. This list is not trying to be innovative, but maybe you find one or two 
that you have not heard about.

## Getting Started with Data  
Title: Making Sense of Squiggly Lines
Author: Christopher Brown

I think that most people who have had experience with vehicle dynamics have heard, 
read or seen this book. It is one of the most comprehensive books on vehicle dynamics 
and especially helped me in a paper I was doing on solid rear axle race cars. It was 
extremely hard for me to find information anywhere on this topic, but of course the bible 
had the answers that I wanted. I would not say this book is light and easy to read and 
I would not recommend it as a first introduction to vehicle dynamics. There is too much 
and the language and style are not always easy to comprehend. I mostly use this book 
for when I have an issue or needs some information, where you can look at the back 
find where the information is and then go and read that section. I would recommend anyone 
thinking of having a career involving vehicle dynamics to purchase this book, but 
for a casual user I would look elsewhere.
