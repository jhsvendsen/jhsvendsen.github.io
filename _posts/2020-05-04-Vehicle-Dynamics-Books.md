## Introduction:  

{% include figure.html path="blog/VDBooks/F1.jpeg" alt="SF90 in Cornering" %}

Studying to the level of MSc, means I have come into contact with many different 
books. Therefore, I thought it would be nice to make a list of the books I enjoyed 
the most. This list is not trying to be innovative, but maybe you find one or two 
that you have not heard about.

## The Bible - Milliken and Milliken 
Title: Race Car Vehicle Dynamics
Author: William F. Milliken and Douglas L. Milliken

I think that most people who have had experience with vehicle dynamics have heard, 
read or seen this book. It is one of the most comprehensive books on vehicle dynamics 
and especially helped me in a paper I was doing on solid rear axle race cars. It was 
extremely hard for me to find information anywhere on this topic, but of course the bible 
had the answers that I wanted. I would not say this book is light and easy to read and 
I would not recommend it as a first introduction to vehicle dynamics. There is too much 
and the language and style are not always easy to comprehend. I mostly use this book 
for when I have an issue or needs some information, where you can look at the back 
find where the information is and then go and read that section. I would recommend anyone 
thinking of having a career involving vehicle dynamics to purchase this book, but 
for a casual user I would look elsewhere.

## From Basic to Advanced
Title: Performance Vehicle Dynamics
Author: James Balkwill

I came across this book as I was studying at Oxford Brookes University, where James 
teaches Advanced Vehicle Dynamics. This book is made to follow his course, but I have 
found that it is great all by itself. When going back to Denmark and talking to the 
guys I used to compete with, I found that one of them had found his book and shared 
it with the others. They all were very interested in what it was like to have James 
as a teacher, cause they all found the book great. For me the reason why this book 
is so good, is that James has an ability to explain complex things in a simple and 
easy to understand way. Anyone with a bit of vehicle dynamics knowledge who wants to 
get to that higher level, to you I would highly recommend James book. It takes you 
from the simple concept up to the point of doing your first modelling in excel. The 
book is interesting and easy to read, so you will not get stuck. He also has put in 
a ton of questions and answers, task and so forth to keep you well entertained for a 
long time.

## The Italian Alternative to Milliken
Title: The Science of Vehicle Dynamics
Author: Massimo Guiggiani

This book was introduced to me when I arrived at Ferrari. Inside of Ferrari this is 
considered to be the book for vehicle dynamics, even higher than Milliken. This might 
be because the author is Italian and have friends inside, but let’s not focus to much 
on that, cause it’s a great book. The benefits of this book over Milliken is that for 
someone wanting to do a laptime sim or needs to model some dynamics, then this provides 
many more equations for exactly that. It stills talks about concept of Vehicle Dynamics, 
but has a greater focus on how to model them. This is very handy for when you are doing 
your models and you need to know how to add this degree of freedom. The downside is that 
I feel that it does not go into as much detail about the concepts as Milliken does. 
So to me these books actually complement each other, even though people often see it as 
one or the other.
