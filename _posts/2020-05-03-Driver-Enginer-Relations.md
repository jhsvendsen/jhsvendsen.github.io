## Introduction:  
Driver coaching is one of those things, where there is not one recipe on how to do it. 
I am not even sure that the word “driver coaching” is correct all the time as it varies 
from driver to driver on how much coaching needs to be done. Through the last couple of 
years I have worked with a wide range of drivers in different scenarios, so I will try 
to tell you my experience and maybe it can help you.

## Talking to Experienced Drivers

I personally think that this can be one of the easiest and hardest parts as an engineer.
It can be tough because the person you are evaluating is someone you might admire greatly 
as was the case with my first experience with Casper Elgaard. I grew up watching him and
having to talk about his performance was a challenge, as it could feel wrong to say
what he was doing wrong. Luckily in this season I was also participating in the endurance
side of Massive Motorsport, where we had hired Gus from Prodrive and I was able to ask 
for his advice. He's advice was to feel out the driver, normally experience drivers are 
able to adjust and feel which are the best driving lines and just want some confirmation 
that what they are feeling is the truth. You should not shower them with suggestions but 
talk to them about what they are feeling and then use the data to confirm or deny that. 
So now I had the approach to the problem, but I still needed some way to overcome that 
the driver was a hero of mine. Here I can only say that you get used to it with time, If 
the driver is good, then he will take your feedback and it will become natural in the end. 
Today I feel good meeting most drivers and talking even with some of the most famous drivers. 
The last time I had the sensation of being stunned by a driver was at Ferrari when Vettel 
came into the office. Somehow seeing an F1 driver in real life felt a bit different. You 
have seen them so many times on TV, that when you see them in real life it makes the moment 
seem unreal. But I will bet that as with anything else it is just a question of the abnormal 
becoming the new normal with time.

## Talking to Un-experienced Drivers

This is an area in which I have experience from my second year in Massive Motorsport and 
my time in Formula Student. I will start with my time with Massive Motorsport in a year 
where the team decided to bring in some new talent, to try and create the next generation 
of drivers.

I had two drivers to which I had to coach throughout the season, but with very different 
approaches to racing. Both were exceptionally keen on becoming better drivers, but only 
one was willing to put in the work. I tried hard to get the other driver excited about data 
and how it could help, but unfortunately, he was just not interested. He had problems with 
shifting as these cars were stick shift and required finesse, that he had not learned in Go karting.
This was costing him a lot of time and it almost made no sense looking at other issues. 
 I tried to show him the data, but it didn't seem to stick, so I showed him video and had our most 
 experience driver talks him through it. None of these seemed to work and I think at some point, 
you have to accept that not every driver is interested in this kind of feedback. 
With such a driver my advice is just to try your best and talk to them whenever you can, but do not 
blame yourself when he is not improving. 
The second driver was young and fierce, every night we would spend hours looking at data 
and video from the experienced driver in the team. Here I would recommend using video and 
if available video with data overlay. You should also use data, but for many young drivers 
it is much easier to see the actual difference on video. Come to think about it, even in 
Ferrari, the drivers were looking at onboard videos. But I have also met drivers who did 
not like looking at other videos, the preferred data traces as they are quick to get an 
overview with. 
To me one of the more interesting experiences was that this eager driver, was sometimes 
to eager to get good results. He is initial season was littered with crashes, which meant 
that he was losing confidence. In these situations, I believe that the best thing you can 
do is to be a friend and not care about what else is happening. When our team would have 
success in a race with the experience driver, I did not go and celebrate with them, I stayed 
with the him and we talked about what went wrong and how we together were going to fix it. 
I think the fact that this driver was chasing even a single point in the beginning and 
ended up winning rookie of the year, is one of my proudest moments in my career. I am not 
saying that it is my fault, this guy had talent. But being a part of this guy climbing the 
ranks just felt incredibly good.

## Summing up

Whether working with at experience or un-experienced you should always listen to the 
driver. You are a team and only with co-operation are you going to achieve great results. 
There is also a reason why some driver and engineer combination keep together for a long 
time. One famous example is Bono and Lewis Hamilton, who often show how valuable it can be 
when there is full trust between engineer and driver.
